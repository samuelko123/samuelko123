Hi, Iâ€™m Samuel Ko.

I have been coding for many years.  
I learned Java and OOP during university.  
I learned VBA and C# when I was auditor.  
I learned Python and SQL when I was system accountant.  
I learned Javascript when my friend asked me to build an attendance web app.

It's so much fun coding!
